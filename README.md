# task-manager
Everything related to the task is done here via seperating the backend and the frontend please note that the architecture in order to provide a restapi backend that the frontend consumes is well defined 

The task of providing a sub tasks can't be obtained due to time constarians but is based on the same architecture 

The task of assigning a user is obtained by providing a default user as login forms are not made same because of time constrain

all well is in this project deployed too on heroku it fullfils every need and the restapi with frontend architecture is well defined 


Kindly check it and if any doubt arises please let me know
